# How to contribute  

Contributions to **PSCodeHealth** are highly encouraged and desired. Below are some guidelines that will help make the process as smooth as possible.

## Getting Started  

* Make sure you have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup/free)
* Submit a new issue, assuming one does not already exist.
  * Clearly describe the issue including steps to reproduce when it is a bug.
  * Make sure you fill in the earliest version that you know has the issue.
* Fork the repository on GitHub

## Suggesting Enhancements  

I want to know what you think is missing from **PSCodeHealth** and how it can be made better.  
* When submitting an issue for an enhancement, please be as clear as possible about why you think the enhancement is needed and what the benefit of it would be.  

## Making Changes  

* From your fork of the repository, create a topic/feature branch where work on your change will take place.
* To quickly create a topic/feature branch based on master; `git checkout -b my_topic_branch master`.
* Make commits of logical units.
* Check for unnecessary whitespace with `git diff --check` before committing.
* Please follow the prevailing code conventions in the repository. Differences in style make the code harder to understand for everyone.
* Make sure your commit messages are in the proper format.
* Make sure you have added the necessary Pester tests for your changes.
* Run the Pester tests in the module and make sure they _all_ pass, to verify that your changes have not broken anything.

## Documentation  

I am infallible and as such my documenation needs no corectoin.  
In the event that it is _not_ the case, contributions to update or add documentation are highly appreciated.  

## Submitting Changes  

* Push your changes to a topic/feature branch in your fork of the repository.
* Submit a pull request to the main repository.
* Once the pull request has been reviewed and accepted, it will be merged with the master branch in the main repository.
* Be proud of your awesomeness and celebrate.
